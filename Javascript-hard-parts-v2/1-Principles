************** Javascript Principles: ******************

Thread of Execution
- Goes through the code line by line and runs/executes each line of code known as the thread of execution.
- The thread of execution is the order in which the code is executed.
- Saves 'data' like strings and arrays so we can use that data later in its memory.
- We can even save code (functions)

Functions
- Running a functions creates a brand new execution context (local memory, thread of execution)
- First the input, the placeholder is called parameter and the value is called argument
- Then the body of the function is executed

Call Stack
- The call stack is a list of functions that are currently being executed (thread of execution)
- Run a function, it is pushed to the call stack
- When the function is done executing, it is popped off the call stack
- Whatever is top of the call stack is the current function running
- The global function is the first function to run and is always at the bottom
