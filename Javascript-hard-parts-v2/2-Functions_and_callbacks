************** Functions and Callbacks ******************

We can generalize the function to make it more reusable
‘Parameters’ (placeholders) mean we don’t need to decide what data to run our
functionality on until we run the function
- Then provide an actual value (‘argument’) when we run the function
- Functions are first class objects, functions have all the features of objects

Higher order functions:
- We may not want to decide exactly what some of our functionality is until we run our function
- We could generalize our function - So we pass in our specific instruction only when we run copyArrayAndManipulate 
- A HOF takes in a function as an argument or passes out a function as a return value
- They keep our code more DRY, Don't repeat yourself, more reusable code.
