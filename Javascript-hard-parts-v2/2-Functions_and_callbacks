************** Functions and Callbacks ******************

We can generalize the function to make it more reusable
‘Parameters’ (placeholders) mean we don’t need to decide what data to run our
functionality on until we run the function
- Then provide an actual value (‘argument’) when we run the function

Higher order functions:
- We may not want to decide exactly what some of our functionality is until we run our function
- We could generalize our function - So we pass in our specific instruction only when we run copyArrayAndManipulate
